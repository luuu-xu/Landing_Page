# landing-page
Landing Page project from TOP.
This will be a webpage showcasing what I have learned from TOP: creating html, adding css stylesheet to it, styling with various tools up to flexbox.

The Landing Page project is finished! It was a medium difficulty task, the flexbox methods were used heavily, while some other css styles are applied too.
The most confusing, or taking up most of my time subtask is to adjusting the width of the containers for various contents. Setting up wrappers with background-color is easy, while setting up the width of the actual container for its content is somehow more complicated. 
It is more of an aesthtics issue rather than technical I assume. How it will fit on a phone screen is not considered in the project.
Why it took much of my time: should I set the container width as percentage e.g. 60% of the view width, or should I set the container to have a fixed width, but it can also be flex-grow or flex-shrink in the meantime with flexbox method.
In the end, I picked some max-width: ?px for the containers and call it a day. 
I am looking forward on how this issue/choice should be solved/picked.
